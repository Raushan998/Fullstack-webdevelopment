    <h1>Welome to Your First Exercise!</h1>
    <p>For this exercise we will be creating a weight metric converter</p>
    <p>We will take a number in pounds(lbs) and convert it to kilpgrams(kg).Right now we only know enough to this one way,but later on we will learn how to add logic to this sort of problem!</p>
    <p>To complete this exercise do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Link this HTML file (part3_exercise.html) to our wn file</li>
      <li>Use Javascript to accept a number input in pounds(lbs)</li>
      <li>Then in your Js file convert this number to kilogram(*0.454)</li>
      <li>Afterward report bak in an alert what the weight is in kg</li>
      <li>Then log/write "Conversion completed" to the console</li>
    </ul>
